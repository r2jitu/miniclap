# MiniClap

Minimalist Command-Line Argument Parser for Rust

MiniClap makes it easy to add a command-line interface to your Rust application without adding any bloat. It is inspired by the de-facto standard crates, [Clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) and [StructOpt](https://crates.io/crates/structopt), but is opinionated towards simplicity over full functionality. By doing as much work as possible at compile-time, it greatly reduces complexity and binary size at runtime.
